# AU Deep Learning Course assignments

During the course I wrote neural network models for various tasks: object detection, embedding, VAE, reinforcement learning, etc. Each folder is a different home task - usually, a couple of `.ipynb` files. Not all code inside is written by me - something was there already.

We used tensorflow and tflearn.
